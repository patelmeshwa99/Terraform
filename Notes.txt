1. Install terraform using homebrew.
2. Install tfswitch if you want to switch between different terraform versions.
3. Securely store your keys using:
    - Vault Provider
    - AWS Cli
    - Environment variables

4. terraform init (cmd) => Initialize the project by letting it know all the dependencies/modules/plugins that the project needs and allow the project to pull them out from internet.
5. terraform plan (cmd) => It tells terraform about the current state of infrastructure. i.e what all has been created and what needs to be newly created.
6. terraform apply (cmd) => This will actually create the resources
7. terraform destroy (cmd) => actually destroy the resources in the current state.
8. Dynamic blocks are used when you want to run the same code but with/for dynamic input variables. For eg: for ingress rule for different ports
9. Terraform modules: Modules are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group. Basically, its about creating a group of files that contains common and re-usable code.
    - If you make any change related to this, you'll have to trigger terraform init command again
